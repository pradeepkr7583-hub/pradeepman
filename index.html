        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        Hello! I’m Pradeep Kumar Mandal, a dedicated and enthusiastic Computer Science student with a strong interest in technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by how computers work and how software can make life easier. This curiosity has grown into a passion for programming, web development, and exploring new technologies.<br><br>I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and analytically. Whether it’s writing clean and efficient code, designing responsive web pages, or understanding how algorithms work, I always try to approach every task with focus and determination. I believe in learning by doing, so I regularly take up small projects and coding exercises to improve my skills.<br><br>Along with technical interests, I value good communication, teamwork, and personal growth. As an introvert, I constantly push myself to improve my communication skills and become more confident in expressing ideas. I also enjoy helping others by sharing knowledge, solving doubts, and working collaboratively on assignments or projects.<br><br>My goal is to build a strong foundation in software development and eventually contribute to meaningful real-world technologies. I am always eager to learn more, explore new opportunities, and grow as both a student and a future developer.
